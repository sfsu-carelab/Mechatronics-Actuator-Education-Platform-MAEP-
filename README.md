# Mechatronics-Actuator-Education-Platform-MAEP-
The proposed laboratory curriculum encompasses an all-in-one mechatronics actuator test platform for the study of fundamental actuator technologies, 
including a direct current brushed motor, stepper, and radio control servo motor that is generally taught in an undergraduate mechatronics course.  

The available files include the design CAD part files and PCB Eagle ciruit schematics to recreate the actuator test plaform as a teaching laboratory equipment.  Datasheets and documentation of the motors used are available including pictures of the final built platform.  Design adjustments would need to be made if mounting motors from different vendor and model number.

An example lab manual with sample code is provided for operating the brushed dc motor for learners to develop their own motor drive modes using an H-Bridge driver.
